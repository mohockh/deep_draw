A system for playing basic video poker, and training/generating trianing data, for a neural network AI to learn how to play such games.

Hat tip to Erik of DeepPink, which implements a Theano system for chess.
https://github.com/erikbern/deep-pink

Basic components:
- Card, Deck, PokerHand classes
- shuffle, deal, draw operations
- evaulate a poker hand [imports C-lang methods]
- assign rewards to hands

I/O components:
- In this system, we compute "truth" for a given hand, based on all 32 possible draw combinations.
- Of course we could look up the "right move," but that's not what we are doing here.
- Instead, we compute an average return for every possible draw. 
...which is what we want the AI to learn.

Because you see.. it's not about making the best move with each draw. It's about optimizing value, and learning important patterns that create value, within a system.
